# Fystart Privacy Policy

Welcome to our fystart. We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. Please read this privacy policy carefully to understand how we collect, use, and protect your information.

## Information Collection

Our browser start page utilizes a third-party service called ChatGPT, provided by OpenAI, for the search feature. When you use the search functionality, your search queries and related information will be sent to the ChatGPT service to provide search results and relevant suggestions. We do not associate this information with any personally identifiable information.

However, we provide customizable options, and you can choose to disable this feature by adjusting the settings in your browser.

Please note that ChatGPT is an independent third-party service, and its use and protection of personal information are governed by its own privacy policy. We recommend that you read and understand their privacy policy before using the ChatGPT service.

## Log Data

We may collect log data about your usage of the browser start page. This log data may include your IP address, access time, browser type and version, operating system information, and more. We use this log data for the improvement, troubleshooting, and security monitoring of the browser start page. It is not associated with any personally identifiable information.

## Third-Party Services

Our browser start page may contain links or content from third-party websites or services. Please note that these third-party sites or services have their own privacy policies, and we are not responsible for their actions and practices. Before accessing these third-party links or using their services, please read and understand their privacy policies.

## Security

We have implemented reasonable security measures to protect the information you provide to us. We use local storage technology to enhance user experience and functionality instead of cookies. Local storage is a method of storing data in your browser that offers higher security compared to cookies.

Please note that while we take security measures to protect your information, the internet is not an entirely secure environment, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of information transmitted over the internet.

## Changes

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated privacy policy will be posted on our browser start page and will replace any previous versions. We recommend that you review this privacy policy periodically to understand how we handle information.
